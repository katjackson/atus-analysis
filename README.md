# Analysis of ATUS Data

This repository contains some interesting insights into the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.

###--Primary Libraries--
Pandas<br>
Matplotlib

###--Topics Explored--
Data management<br>
Finding outliers<br>
Grouping and aggregating data<br>
Making observations<br>
Finding correlation<br>

All of my techniques and observations are recorded in the [American Time Use jupyter notebook](https://github.com/katjackson/atus-analysis/blob/master/American%20Time%20Use.ipynb). With the help of the Pandas library I organized the data into manageable data frames that I could pull some useful information from. This includes statistics, line graphs, and correlation plots on Male vs. Female reports of interior house cleaning.

The download_data.sh file can be used to easily download and unzip all of the ATUS data files.
